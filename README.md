### By Darren Fitzpatrick - G00311853

## Introduction
This project provides the design and documentation for the dataset "Galway City puplic Sports Facilities" which is available at [data.gov.ie](http://data.gov.ie)

The **Galway City Public Sports Facilities** Dataset provides the user with all the information about all the sport facilities in the Galway region. The API would be very beneficial for tourists interested in sports, or the active youths in the area. The API has the type and name of pitch and also could also utilise Sat Nav as the the Dataset includes the coordinates.

## About the data
This dataset was received in Comma Separated Values (CSV) format, and was downloaded from [*Galway City Public Sports Facilities*](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/galway-city-public-sports-facilities/resource/2db7c358-4ec1-4cfb-9456-d935cc0157aa).
The CSV file contains 48 rows, the first being a header row with the names of each field.
